# Psychotropic drugs on *Drosophila* brain at the single cell resolution 

This repository contains the **codes and website** for our manuscript entitled **“The effects of methylphenidate and atomoxetine on *Drosophila* brain at single-cell resolution and potential drug repurposing for ADHD treatment”**.

Our study highlights a novel approach to rapidly and cost-effectively explore the drug basis of psychiatric disorders using *Drosophila* models, which provides a comprehensive resource for gene function in the *Drosophila* brain and future drug research in psychiatric disorders.

## **Codes**

Our scRNASEQ data were mainly processed by Seurat, R codes used for analyses are in the following files:

正在整理，路径如下：D:\坚果云同步文件\我的坚果云\recent_Prj_docs\2021_FlyDrug_scRNAseq

`01_scRNAseq_flyADHDrugs_CelltypeCluster.R`——这个弄好了；

`02_scRNAseq_flyADHDrugs_DEGs.R` ——正在弄

`03_xxxxx.R`

## ADHDrug 

We built the 💜 [ADHDrug.cibr.ac.cn](adhdrug.cibr.ac.cn/) 💜 for visualization that enables users to view single-cell RNA-seq data and query specific gene expression in various cell types.

- Two drugs of the scRNA-seq data have been added in the datasets.
- The first version was released on Jan 12th, 2023.
